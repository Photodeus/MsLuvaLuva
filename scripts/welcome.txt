Hello $nick my old friend, I've come to talk with you again.
Hello $nick. I love you. Let's talk some trash.
Ay caramba! It's $nick!
Hello and welcome to the last days of your sanity, $nick!
It is generally agreed that "Hello" is an appropriate greeting because if you entered a room and said "Goodbye" $nick, it could confuse a lot of people. So hello $nick.
Hello $nick! It's a bee-yooo-tiful day for chatting. Don't you agree?
You had me at hello, $nick.
Yo $nick! Wazzup.
Hey there $nick. Came to spill your guts? Just make sure to clean up the mess later on.
Oh it's you again, $nick!
Hey there $nick. Welcome <3
Wow, finally someone cool enters chat! Look everyone, it's $nick!
This is getting better and better, $nick just entered!
*pokes* $nick
$nick, Hello, good evening and welcome to the middle of the film.
$nick, Good morning starshine, the Earth says hello!
$nick! I was JUST thinking of you!
$nick! I was JUST thinking of you! Well, not really... I only said it to be nice.
How are you today $nick?
Ready for some awesome nolife with us, $nick?
Be alert $nick, you just stirred up the beehive.
Be alert $nick, you just stirred up the beehive... or there's no honey for you!
$nick. Is that a smile I see on your face? Oh come on, I know you are smiling now :D
$nick, you look like you could need a hug.
$nick, you look like you could need a kiss.
$nick, you look like you could need a slap. *slaps with a trout*
$nick, came to keep me company?
Sup, $nick?
O hai, $nick!
Is it a bird? Is it an airplane? No, it's $nick!
slm, $nick.
Everyone behave now! $nick entered!
I feel a great disturbance in the Force. Oh, wait nevermind. It's was just $nick who entered.
How nice of you, $nick , to join us. Come sit on my lap and dance
I dunno, let's find $nick and ask? Oh look, speaking of the devil...
